# PhxLiveviewLightController

This was a small test to see how LiveView works by creating a simple light switch following The Pragmatic Studio's ['Getting Started with LiveView'](https://pragmaticstudio.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-phoenix-liveview) tutorial.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create your database with `docker-compose up -d`
  * Migrate database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/light`](http://localhost:4000/light) from your browser.
